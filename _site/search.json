I became adept in managing the availability, usability, integrity and security of the data in enterprise systems.\nFollowing my internship at ScienceLogic, I joined Analysis Group as a Summer Analyst. As one of the largest international economic consulting firms, Analysis Group provides economic, financial and strategy consulting to law firms, corporations & government agencies. As a Summer Analyst, I honed my statistical programming skills by developing data analyses to support clients. I will be returning to Analysis Group as a full-time Analyst in August 2024."
